# Danger HLint [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/danger-hlint.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/danger-hlint)

A Danger plugin for [HLint](https://github.com/ndmitchell/hlint)

Read a full how to at [http://allocinit.io/haskell/danger-and-hlint/](http://allocinit.io/haskell/danger-and-hlint/)

## Installation

Add this line to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'danger-hlint'
```

## Usage

Methods and attributes from this plugin are available in
your `Dangerfile` under the `hlint` namespace.

At the moment one single method is exposed: `hlint.lint`

If you want the lint results to show in the diff instead of in the comments, you can use the `inline_mode` option.
Violations that occur out of the diff will show in danger's fail or warn section. Here's a minimal example of what to add to your `Dangerfile` (read the inline comments):

```ruby
# get all affected files by the changes in the current diff
affected_files = git.added_files + git.modified_files

# limit files to .hs files
haskell_files = affected_files.select { |file| file.end_with?('.hs') }

# run hlint on the files and comment inline in the PR
hlint.lint haskell_files, inline_mode: true

```

To pass other parameters to the linter just add them to the method call. The
names and values of the parameters to the `hlint.lint` method are handed over to linter.

For example, you can specify a hint file by calling

```ruby
hlint.lint files hint: ".hlint.yaml"
```

To pass switches to the linter (like `--quiet`) specify `true` as the value in the call

```ruby
hlint.lint files quiet: true
```

## Warning

When running `danger-hlint` on your CI server **(especially CircleCI 2.0)** make sure that the `hlint` binary is in your `PATH`, else this plugin will silently fail to produce any linting output. One possible way to do this (in CircleCI 2.0) is:

```
      - run:
          name: "Running HLint (via danger-hlint)"
          command: |
            export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
            bundle exec danger
```

## Development

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `bundle install` to setup dependencies.
3. Run `bundle exec rake spec` to run the tests.
4. Use `bundle exec guard` to automatically have tests run as you make changes.
5. Make your changes.
